Treasure Hunt Addendum

This document lists new features, bug fixes and enhancements in all revisions to Treasure Hunt. Most recent revisions will appear at the top of the document.
** 4.40
In this release:
If the player has unlimited health, they can walk over mines without harm.

Bug fixes:
Treasure Hunt now runs on 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows Seven. Previously, the game would crash with the message: "The sound is not of a valid format to be loaded into a three-d positional buffer."
The game no longer temporarily stalls when a guard spots the player. In some cases, if the player was ambushed, this would cause poisoned needles to never hit their targets.

**4.30
Notes: Because of some changes in the codebase, this version of Treasure Hunt is not compatible with saved games from earlier versions.

In this release:

Bug fixes:
If the player killed over 5000 guards, the game would crash. In addition, if the points score reached this value, this would also cause a crash bug. These problems have been corrected.

**4.25
In this release:

Bug fixes:
If a game was saved while the player had control of a guard by way of the MCB, loading that game and toggling to the MCB would leave the game unresponsive until the player toggled to a different weapon.

**4.20 Beta#1.0
In this version of Treasure Hunt, we have greatly enhanced the stability of the game, and increased its responsiveness. Players should notice smoother gameplay than 4.01. Guards are now more responsive (after much testing, it was found that the guards were moving slower than intended.)

Added some TSS notifications.

The BPC Update Wizard has been improved: players do not have to run the th.exe program before their newly downloaded version is registered.
The "ghost bug" has been fixed: if the player killed a guard using a remote controled missile, the ghost of the guard would remain, causing a false alarm in the player's Audient.
The file shield.wav is now included.
The menu bars which would cause malfunctions in the game have been removed since the self-voicing menus have been added.
Fixed caption of window.
Fixed crash when a player loads a game from a slot to which the player has not saved yet.

**4.02
In this release:
A new version naming scheme has been taken: From this version forward, all minor revisions will have their own revision numbers, rather than "patch 1 for 4.01." This was done to ease the task of the BPC Wizard; users should be able to stay current with updates.
The BPC Update Wizard is packaged with the game: this wizard allows for instant and easy updating of Treasure Hunt, whether it'd be a small patch or a major substitute install.

Bug fixes:

**4.01 Beta#1.2

New sounds have been added.
A background theme has been added.
Fighting has been improved.

**3.00 (Release)
This is the first public release of Treasure Hunt 3.00. Bug fixes and features can be found in the beta documentation below. In this release:
Challengers are interactive.
You have three goals to meet instead of one.
Sounds have been added to the game.
A save/load feature has been added.
Walls have been added, and the grid has been enlarged.

**Beta#2
This version is one of our major beta releases; we have added various new features and fixed a numerous amount of bugs. In this release:
Challengers may call others to their assistance.
Challengers can now spot you from one sector's length; you do not have to be on a challenger's sector for it to spot you.
You may now find out how many challengers are after you by pressing C.
We have increased speed of battle; challengers should be more responsive; as a result you don't experience that 2 second delay between last shot and challenger dying.
You may now get your current health by pressing H.
You are now able to use your sword in battle.
You may now fight multiple challengers at one given time.
Challengers now have an alert timer: If you are fighting a challenger and you run out of bullets, once you leave that sector and the challenger does not spot you for some time, it will go off its alert.

Bug fixes:
The save/load feature is now compatible with TH 3.0; players should be able to save/load games with no difficulties.
We have fixed some potential "subscript out of range" errors.
The S key has been corrected; this key would only report the direction of your goal posts--this was due to a minor change in processing. The S key now gives full status as in previous versions.
The save/load feature now saves and loads your options found in the "Options" menu.
The H key no longer gives a "type mismatch" error; this was seen as a potential problem when using the P key to obtain current points as well, and we have set gards against it.
The battle music no longer restarts after every spot.
We have corrected occasional  hang-ups which would freeze the game.
Players should no longer experience "out-of-range errors" etc.
If multiple challengers are fighting you at once, you are able to kill them all; in previous releases, only one challenger could be faught and the player was forced to move away from and back to that sector to finish the battle; once the focused challenger was defeated, the other challengers would be invisible.
We have also corrected a long-life bug where the portal passages (or teleports as was their name before this beta) may drop you on a wall, causing the game to crash; also, in further enhancements, we have secured the flight effectively denying a land outside the walls.

**Beta#1
In this release, we have implemented challenger-interactivity. we have many bugs to fix, however.

**3.00
This version of Treasure Hunt has incorporated a new gaming concept: players will now encounter walls which must be destroyed by bombing, players must activate the control panel, get the key, and kill 5 challengers before picking up the treasure---this makes TH more exciting than it was in the 2.00 release.

**2.50 (beta)
This version of Treasure Hunt was never a public release but rather a beta release. In this version:
A save/load feature has been added.
The option to not display text on-screen or speak it has been added.

Bug fixes:
TH allowed players to move out-of-bounds which would in turn result in a runtime error.

**2.00
This version of Treasure Hunt is the first Treasure Hunt for Windows. In this release:
We have added teleport to both the FS and the Windows version.
We have concatinated direction string so directions are generated as "NorthWest" and not "north
West."

----------
Note: The following documentation refers to the FSNotetaker version and MS-DOS version of TH. TH for Windows comes in to play in the 2.00 release after this release for the FSNotetaker and MS-DOS. Note: After the release of TH 2.00 for Windows, we have discontinued development for the FSNotetaker and MS-DOS versions in terms of Treasure Hunt.
Bug fixes
If a player reaches end of grid, a blank display or line would be printed.
Moving out-of-bounds at sector (21,7) in the FS version would result in runtime error 1; the program was supposed to wrap.

The water has been removed and the out-of-bounds bug has been fixed.

**1.02
